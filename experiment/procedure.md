### Procedure

1. Collect the sand sample in a container.
2. Take a measuring cylinder and fill its 2/3 part with the collected sand sample.
3. Gently level off the top surface of sand using a steel ruler.
4. Measure the height of loose sand and note it down.
5. Transfer the sand from the measuring cylinder into a cleaned beaker.
6. Refill half of the cylinder with water.
7. Pour the sand from the beaker into the cylinder. Add it in 3 parts.
8. Stir the poured sand in the cylinder gently with a tamping rod having a diameter of 6 mm.
9. Level the top surface of the inundated sand carefully and note down the reading.
10. Perform the same procedure for two more samples of sand. The average of three observations gives the bulkage of sand in percentage.
